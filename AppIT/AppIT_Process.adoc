== Introduction
The AppSW iTC needs to provide timely responses to requests for interpretation from the CC community. For that purpose, an ‘AppSW iTC Interpretation Team’ (AppIT) is established which is in charge of handling the requests for interpretation. The AppIT shall act according to the process defined in this document.
Process Description

== Overview
The following figure shows the overall process:

In general, the APPSW iTC’s ToR shall apply, especially for decision making. When handling requests for interpretation, the group’s main goal should be to come to consensus. According to ISO/IEC Guide 2:2004 Standardization and related activities, consensus is “General agreement, characterized by the absence of sustained opposition to substantial issues by any important part of the concerned interests and by a process that involves seeking to take into account the views of all parties concerned and to reconcile any conflicting arguments. 

This applies at two particular points in Figure 1:

* Decisions on ‘action required’ (i.e., whether an interpretation is to be produced or the request rejected)
* Adoption of an interpretation as definitive (in this case the fact that the interpretation was subject to a vote, the number of votes cast and the number in favour of the adopted conclusion shall be recorded as part of the interpretation). 

If reaching consensus at either of these stages is deadlocked then a vote shall be taken on acceptance or rejection of a proposal for a specific course of action. At least five members of the AppIT must cast a vote for the vote to be valid. The AppIT group leader and deputy shall ensure that the votes cast are preserved, but these will not be routinely published (publication would be expected only if it becomes necessary at a later stage to demonstrate that an interpretation accurately reflects the votes cast).

For all votes, the general rule of ‘one vote per organization’ (compared to ‘one vote per individual’) shall apply (as defined in the iTC’s ToR). The preferred way to handle votes should be via call.

If the group encounters a deadlock situation, the group needs to decide on its next course of action.  Before the decision is made there shall be a coordination time of one week which may allow resolving the issue. In case the deadlock situation cannot be resolved within the coordination time, a decision shall be made by the group how to proceed. If unanimity cannot be achieved as to the preferred course, then it may be decided by simple majority (i.e., 51%) of respondents to a request for an email response from the members of the AppIT between the following two alternatives:

* The proposal may be reworked, and voting repeated after revision, or 
* The decision may be handed over to the whole iTC. 

Members of the AppIT should refrain from deciding not to participate in a vote. Members of the AppIT should try to personally contribute to the work of the AppIT to ensure continuity and consistency. They should make only rare use of delegation to other representatives of their organization (e.g., extended absence). All members of the AppIT can take advice of other members of their organization for their decision making, of course.   

== RFI Workflow

=== Process

To enter an RFI, the originator shall create an RFI issue in the iTCs github repository using the appropriate issue template. (https://github.com/appswcpp/repository/issues).

Based on the estimated number of requests and the expertise of the members of the AppIT it is expected that the AppIT will be able to handle requests in a first come first serve method.  

RFIs will be given priority over other items of new business. 

If a member of the AppIT works for an entity that is involved in a request for interpretation, the member should disclose this involvement (full disclosure). Due to this full transparency, there is no need to restrict the participation of this team member in the decision process, i.e., this member can still provide information on the subject, voice an opinion and participate in the vote (if applicable).

Once the AppIT determines how to handle the issue, comments will be added to the issue in git and closed. A designated location will be published with the list of all active and archived RFIs.

=== Feedback to originator of an RFI 
The AppIT is publishing their results on its related infrastructure (currently on Github). Originators of RFIs should check the AppIT related infrastructure for updates. Nevertheless, the AppIT intends to actively inform all originators of RFIs about the outcome of their RFI. AppIT will not provide status updates, though. In case an RFI is forwarded to the AppIT via a third party (e.g., a vendor's request which is forwarded to the AppIT via a laboratory or scheme), AppIT intends to provide the feedback to the forwarding third party expecting that this party will inform the true originator of the AppIT accordingly.
If the AppIT has trouble to assess an RFI due to the lack of information or lack of clarity in the description of the RFI, the AppIT will decide whether it wants to seek clarification of the RFI or to reject the RFI. In case AppIT is seeking clarification for the RFI, the AppIT will contact the originator of the RFI or the forwarding third party, respectively.

=== Focus of AppIT work 
The AppIT is responsible for providing interpretations of the cPPs and SDs created and maintained by the APPSW iTC. What is summarized as 'Requests for Interpretation' (RFIs) is intended to trigger different types of actions according to the nature of each RFI. For example, an RFI could be intended to result in the modification of obviously erroneous requirements (i.e., error correction), a clarification of existing requirements, or the modification (including adding or deleting) of requirements. This holds for both cPPs and SDs.  

The overall objective for the AppIT is not to introduce new requirements, though - neither through changes to the cPPs nor the SDs because this is more properly done by a process that is open to the whole iTC. However, experience has shown that it is not always straightforward to determine when a new requirement is being introduced: this assessment is in general a subjective one, and the AppIT cannot easily guarantee that a change will not be perceived by some iTC participant as a new requirement. The alternative would be to subject all RFIs to review by the wider iTC which is not desirable because of the additional time this would impose in resolving each RFI. 

To implement a process that allows the AppIT to serve a useful purpose and to respond efficiently to RFIs whilst also respecting the potential impact on the wider iTC, the handling of RFIs by the AppIT should therefore be in agreement with the following rules: 

If an AppIT member feels that an AppIT Interpretation (which is handled by the AppIT itself without seeking agreement by the APPSW iTC) is introducing a new requirement or removing an existing requirement then this should be raised during discussion of the interpretation, and ultimately (if other members of the AppIT involved in the discussion do not agree at the time) then the member should vote against the proposed AppIT Interpretation. The rules defined for AppIT's voting and decision-making process should then be sufficient to ensure that if a significant minority of AppIT members believe that a requirement is being changed in a way that exceeds the remit of the AppIT, then agreement to the interpretation will have to be sought from the APPSW iTC.

== Impact of Technical Decisions and Technical Recommendations on previous and future versions of cPPs and SDs 
Technical Decisions and Technical Recommendations might also apply to previous versions of cPPs and SDs. Any new Technical Decision and Technical Recommendations will also be checked against previous cPP versions and SD versions which are still regarded as 'supported versions' by the APPSW iTC. Versions which are no longer supported by the APPSW iTC will not be checked. The reply to an RFI might need different wording for different cPP or SD versions. 

Technical Decisions and Technical Recommendations are expected to be integrated into the next version of the corresponding cPP or SD, respectively. For example, a TD that is created while APPSWcPP V1 is the current version should be integrated into APPSWcPP V2. In case a TD or TR is created after public review of a new document version (e.g., during the editing phase of APPSWcPP V2 after public review but prior to release of APPSWcPP V2), this TD or TR might not make it into the new version and might therefore also apply to the new version (in this case V2). After release of a new cPP or SD version, the AppIT will check which TDs and TRs also apply to the new version and update the TDs and TRs respectively as AppIT. This is limited to a difference of one version. For example, if APPSWcPP V3 is released, only TDs and TRs related to APPSWcPP V2 are considered because all TDs and TRs related to APPSWcPP V1 should have been integrated latest in APPSWcPP V3.

== Participation 

=== Membership in general 
AppIT members are expected to actively contribute to AppIT activities and participate in the decision-making process. In particular members are expected to commit to at least a 50% level of attendance at AppIT online meetings. For the purposes of this threshold, attendance may include meetings attended by a nominated deputy on the member’s behalf, provided these comprise less than 50% of the member’s semi-annual attendances. For the purposes of this threshold, this may include votes provided by a nominated deputy on the member’s behalf, provided these comprise less than 50% of the member’s votes on semi-annual average. Participation rates in AppIT online meetings and votes are checked every 6 months by the group leader.

Membership is in general unlimited in time as long as no special incidents occur (e.g., see regulations below if new applicants want to join the AppIT or regulations on involuntary leaving AppIT). Only members of the APPSW iTC can become AppIT members. AppIT will inform the APPSW iTC about all changes to the list of members. 

The number of members of the AppIT should not exceed 15 and should also not drop below 5. If this happen, a warning should be sent to the APPSW iTC. If the number of members drops below 3, the AppIT should stop their work on requests for interpretation and hand this work over to the APPSW iTC until the number of members has increased to at least 3 members. 

From time to time the AppIT may, at its discretion, accept non-voting participation by official representatives of the CC community (e.g., CCDB representatives, Scheme representatives, iTC or subgroup chairs, etc.). Non-voting participants are welcome to attend meetings and give input as they see AppIT. 

Non-voting participants are not subject to the same thresholds for meeting attendance as voting members. In particular the AppIT intends that the involvement of non-voting participants should encourage greater levels of Scheme participation and help to maintain support for cPPs in Position and Endorsement statements. 

To become a non-voting participant, please contact the chair or deputy chair for consideration. The AppIT will discuss and approve using standard voting criteria.

=== Involuntarily leaving the AppIT 
AppIT reserves the right to expel an AppIT member due to major misconduct. Every AppIT member can raise the concern about the conduct of another AppIT member and propose to initiate consideration about expelling the affected AppIT member. For acceptance of such an incident, the proposal needs to be supported by two other AppIT members. If the proposal is not supported by two other AppIT members within two weeks, it will be rejected, and the incident will be documented. If the proposal is supported by two other AppIT members within two weeks, decision making about the incident will be initiated within four weeks. Both sides - the initiator and the affected AppIT member - shall be heard by the AppIT before decision making. 

Regardless of the reason for the proposal of termination of membership, the affected AppIT member shall be informed by the group leader or deputy of the taking place of any such vote, and of its result. If membership of the AppIT is terminated then this does not prevent the individual from re-applying to join the AppIT in future, in which case their application shall be handled as for any other new applicant. 

For all decisions regarding the termination of the membership of an AppIT member 75% of the AppIT members (excluding the affected AppIT member) need to vote in favour of doing so and no more than 25% vote against the termination of the membership of an AppIT member. If the proposal for termination of an AppIT member is accepted by the AppIT, the membership of the affected AppIT member shall be terminated no later than four weeks after the decision.

== RFIs 

=== Submitting 
When questions come up regarding the cPPs or SDs maintained by APPSW iTC, users are encouraged to submit a Request for Interpretation (RFI) to the AppIT. For on-going certification projects, RFIs shall be sent through the scheme related to the certification. All requests outside running certification projects (e.g., during a project preparation phase or during gap analysis) can be sent also to the AppIT directly via Github, e.g., by vendors, consultants or laboratories. To do so, the user should submit a Github Issue using the template provided by the AppIT for RFI submittal on link:https://github.com/appswcpp/repository/issues[Github].

* Document affected 
* Section in question (reference to SFR or subchapter in SD) 
* Question (RFIs are restricted to single questions except RFIs submitted by schemes) 
* Proposed solution (if any) 
* Whether the question pertains to a current certification 

The AppIT will prioritize the RFI according to its documented criteria and return a response after consideration.

AppIT requests that interpretations made by Schemes in the course of their certifications against the cPPs maintained by APPSW iTC are notified to the AppIT, so that the cPPs, SDs and interpretations (as appropriate) can be updated using this feedback. This will help to maintain the visibility of Evaluation Activities and hence the consistency and reproducibility of evaluations against the relevant cPPs.
